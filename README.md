# SystemOS – Decision Briefings

SystemOS publishes structured decision briefings and operating documents.

The focus is on:
- clarity over noise
- judgment over information
- systems over opinions

This repository contains **public abstracts and summaries**.
Full decision documents are published externally.

## How to read these briefings

Each briefing follows a consistent structure:
- Problem framing
- Evaluation criteria
- Clear judgment (ignore / watch / act)
- Key risks and trade-offs

The goal is not to provide more information,  
but to reduce complexity and decision effort.
