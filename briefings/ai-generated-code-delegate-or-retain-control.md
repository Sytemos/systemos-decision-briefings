# AI-Generated Code: Delegate or Retain Control

This is a public abstract. The full decision brief is available as a PDF.

Engineering leads must decide whether to delegate more coding work to AI tools (including increasingly agentic workflows) or retain tighter human control.

The core issue is not “can AI write code,” but whether the organization can capture routine speed gains without increasing security exposure, technical debt, and compliance/IP risk.

## Decision Criteria
1. Net delivery impact — cycle-time gain without hidden downstream cost  
2. Security posture — no increase in vulnerabilities or review bypass  
3. Maintainability — no rise in churn or system-incoherent code  
4. Accountability & compliance — auditable SDLC regardless of authorship  
5. Legal/IP & data governance — acceptable provenance and data exposure risk  
6. Operational fit — governance of permissions, logging, and agentic tools

## Judgment: ACT
Adopt a controlled delegation model: delegate AI to routine, well-scoped tasks inside strict human-owned gates, and retain human control for architecture, security-sensitive code, and all agentic tool execution.
