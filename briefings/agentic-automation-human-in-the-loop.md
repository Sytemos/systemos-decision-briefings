# Agentic Automation: Build Workflows — Keep Humans in the Loop

This is a public abstract of a SystemOS Decision Brief.

**Core Judgment (ACT):**  
Build agentic workflows only in a constrained, approval-gated model.  
Autonomy is a risk multiplier, not a default efficiency win.

---

## The One-Sentence Autonomy Rule

**If an agent can take an action you would need to explain to Security, Legal, or a customer, it may propose — but it may not execute.**

---

## Non-Negotiable Kill Switches

Autonomous execution is prohibited if ANY of the following is true:

- The agent can deploy, delete, send, or merge without approval  
- The agent touches credentials, identity, or secrets  
- The agent processes untrusted external input  
- The agent can affect customer-visible or financial state  
- Actions are irreversible or cannot be reconstructed post-incident  

---

## Why This Decision Matters (2026 Reality)

Agentic systems create throughput — but also introduce:

- Prompt injection risk  
- Automation debt  
- Audit dead-ends  
- Silent escalation across tools  
- Leadership accountability failures
